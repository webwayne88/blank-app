- **Very Conservative**

    Investors who have a very conservative risk tolerance may have a high aversion to the risk of losing money and prioritize preserving their capital. Very conservative investors are likely more comfortable with fixed income and short-term investments, such as bonds, government securities and cash equivalents. A small allocation to equities is possible, but they are likely more willing to accept lower returns in exchange for lower risk.

- **Conservative**
    
    Conservative investors may want to consider balancing risk and return with a higher allocation to stocks but combine it with a significant amount of bonds, government securities and cash equivalents. Steady returns may be a conservative investor's goal, but they also want to maintain a lower level of risk.

- **Moderate**

    With a moderate risk tolerance, balancing risk and return is likely most important. An emphasis on stocks, combined with a significant allocation to bonds, government securities and cash equivalents may help achieve the balance between taking risks and growing a portfolio.

- **Aggressive**
    
    With this level of risk, an aggressive investor may be more willing to take on higher risks for potentially higher returns. Their primary focus may want to be on stocks, including non-U.S. companies, to potentially achieve growth with a smaller allocation to bonds and government securities.

- **Very Aggressive**
    
    Those with a very high-risk tolerance may seek maximum growth potential from their portfolios. Very aggressive investors may consider a strong emphasis on stocks, including non-U.S. companies, while maintaining a much smaller portion of bonds and government securities.
